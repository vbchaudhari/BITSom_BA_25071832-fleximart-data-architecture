# Part 2: NoSQL Analysis (MongoDB)

## Overview
In this part, I managed unstructured product catalog data using MongoDB. This allowed handling products with different attributes (like specs for electronics vs. sizes for fashion) flexibly.

## Files Included
* **products_catalog.json**: The JSON dataset used for MongoDB.
* **mongodb_operations.js**: JavaScript commands for CRUD operations and queries.
* **nosql_analysis.md**: Report comparing SQL vs NoSQL for this use case.
